# üß† Dirty Vanity

**Dirty Vanity** is a novel code injection technique that allows attackers to stealthily execute malicious payloads in Windows by evading Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) systems.

---

## üö® What is Dirty Vanity?

Dirty Vanity splits traditional code injection steps between two processes, using Windows process forking to confuse EDRs and execute malicious code in a cloned process‚Äîwithout alerting security tools.

---

## ü§î What is EDR?

**EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)** is a system that monitors a machine for suspicious activity, especially behaviors like memory allocation, code writing, and code execution within trusted processes.

---

## üß™ Traditional Injection vs. Dirty Vanity

### üß¨ Traditional Code Injection (EDR can detect):
1. Allocate memory in target process
2. Write malicious code into it
3. Execute the code

### ü™û Dirty Vanity (EDR gets confused):
1. Inject code into a normal process (e.g., `explorer.exe`)
2. **Fork** the process using a Windows API (`RtlCreateProcessReflection`)
3. Run the malicious code in the **forked process** (not the original)

‚úÖ Original process remains untouched  
‚ùå EDR doesn‚Äôt see the code execution path

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Why is it Dangerous?

Most EDRs:
- Only monitor the original process
- Don‚Äôt trace memory changes into cloned processes
- Fail to detect when malicious code is run inside a **forked clone**

As a result:
- ‚úÖ Malicious code executes successfully
- ‚úÖ Original process looks clean
- ‚ùå EDR doesn‚Äôt raise an alert

---

## üèóÔ∏è Real-World Example

### Goal: Dump credentials from `lsass.exe`
- **Traditional Way:** Touching `lsass.exe` alerts EDR.
- **Dirty Vanity:** Clone `lsass.exe`, dump credentials from the **clone**‚ÄîEDR doesn‚Äôt detect the operation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements to Run Dirty Vanity

- Permission to write to another process
- Permission to fork a process (`RtlCreateProcessReflection`)
- Basic C/C++ and Windows internals knowledge

---

## üîç Detection & Future Mitigation

Currently, most EDRs are blind to this. Future improvements might include:
- Tracking forks (e.g., `RtlCreateProcessReflection`)
- Linking parent-write events with clone-execution events
- Monitoring memory in forked processes
